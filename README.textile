h2. Django-create

p. A (barely-necessary but handy) shortcut for creating Django projects in an existing location. Made because I just wanted to have to think less.

p. Place this script somewhere handy and run with: python django_start.py

p. Either add the path to your Django projects to the 'project_dir' variable towards the top, or leave blank for a prompt to enter your Django project location, which must exist.

h3. To do

- Have an option to create a Django app in an existing project folder.
