h2. Django-create

p. A (barely-necessary but handy) shortcut for creating Django projects in an existing location. Made because I just wanted to have to think less.

p. Place this script somewhere handy and run it with: ./django-create.py (or python django-create.py).

p. Either add the path to your Django projects to the 'project_dir' variable towards the top, or leave blank for a prompt to enter your Django project location, which must exist.

h3. To do

# Have an option to create a Django app in an existing project folder.

h3. To do

# Prompt for and add default values to settings.py
# Move (cd) to the newly-created project folder (or rewrite as a shell script)
